            <a href="https://play.pokemonshowdown.com">Pokémon Showdown</a> is an open-source simulator that transforms Pokémon's turn-based battles into a
            competitive strategy game enjoyed by thousands of daily players. Competitive Pokémon battles are two-player 
            stochastic games with imperfect information. Players construct teams of Pokémon and guide them through 
            complex battles where stochastic outcomes are driven by nuanced gameplay mechanics. 
            Success requires more than managing randomness; players must effectively model their opponents and make decisions 
            amid uncertainty. Essential details of the opponent’s team remain concealed until they impact the battle, 
            encouraging players to infer hidden information and predict future moves based on past interactions. 
            Expert human players distinguish themselves by accurately anticipating their opponent's strategies. 
            The stochasticity, partial observability, and diverse team options of Pokémon battles challenge AI's ability to plan and generalize.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Though Pokémon Showdown battle bots have existed for many years, advances in language models, large-scale reinforcement learning datasets, 
            and accessible open-source tools have sparked renewed interest within the machine learning research community. Recent methods have achieved human-level
            gameplay in popular singles rulesets, prompting an exciting question: How much further can we push the capabilities of Competitive Pokémon AI?

      <h2 class="text-center mb-2">PokéAgent Showdown</h2>
      <div class="card showdown-content">
       
        <p>
          To avoid disrupting human players, <strong>PokéAgent participants will compete on an AI-focused Showdown server hosted by the competition</strong>. 
          Participants will battle against organizer baselines (and each other!) on a ranked ladder to qualify for a tournament held at the end of the competition window.
        </p>
        <p>
          The competition will be split into three stages:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1. Research Stage (July 11th - September 29th)</strong> The first stage of the competition will be a "free play" period. The PokéAgent server will be open to all participants, with player pools inflated by organizer baselines across a wide range of skill levels. Get started, develop new ideas, and get a sense of how your method stacks up against the competition!
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2. Qualifying Stage (September 29th - October 12th)</strong> On September 29th, the competition formally begins. Each team must register one official username with the organizers. Other usernames will be locked and multi-accounting will be considered cheating. All ratings and leaderboards will be reset, and teams will climb the leaderboards by competing on the ranked ladder. At the end of this stage, the top ranked usernames (excluding organizer baselines) will qualify for the next stage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>3. Tournament Stage (October 15th - October 31st)</strong> Qualifying participants will battle in a single-elimination tournament of best-of-k-battle matches.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For those familiar, this structure follows the general format of a Showdown "ladder tournament" --- but for bots!
        </p>
        <p>
          Because this is the first time a competition like this has been run, a few of the specifics are flexible and will be finalized during the Research Stage in conversation with the community (via discord):
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Showdown Rulesets:</strong> Competitive Pokémon is divided into a wide variety of rulesets (<a href="https://www.smogon.com/bw/articles/bw_tiers" target="_blank">"formats"</a>).
          From the beginning, PokéAgent Showdown will restrict this list to the following formats where ML datasets and baselines are available:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Gen 1 OverUsed (OU)</strong> with the current official rules.</li>
          <li><strong>Gen 2 OU</strong> with the current official rules.</li>
          <li><strong>Gen 3 OU</strong> with the current official rules.</li>
          <li><strong>Gen 4 OU</strong> with the current official rules.</li>
          <li><strong>Gen 9 OU</strong> with the current rules plus the AI-friendly exceptions that Zoroark and the move Revival Blessing are banned.</li>
          <li><strong>Gen 9 VGC</strong> with the official Regulation I rules plus the AI-friendly exceptions that Zoroark and Dondozo are banned.</li>
          (Note that all battles will be played with Showdown's standard time controls <em>enabled</em>)
        </ul>
        <p>
          All of these formats will be available throughout the Research Stage. However, <em>the formal Tournament Stage will limit competition to a subset of this list</em>. Currently, <strong>Gen 1 OU and Gen 9 OU</strong> are guaranteed to have brackets, with additional options to be determined based on the number of participants, ladder activity, community feedback, and available prizes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Bracket Size and Match Length:</strong> Pokémon has high variance. Human tournaments often adopt a best two-out-of-three battle structure. 
          We would prefer to go (significantly) higher, but will work with the qualifying participants to gauge whether this creates a financial burden
          and whether credits provided by our sponsors can assist. The total bracket size (e.g., 8, 16, 32 teams) will be determined 
          based on the number of active entrants and announced well in advance of the Qualifying Stage. The purpose of the Qualifying Stage is to filter 
          the player pool to a smaller group of dedicated teams in order to streamline the organization of the tournament. It is not intended to put undue 
          focus on the matchmaking gamesmanship of climbing ELO points, or on the ability to maintain constant uptime in order to defend your ranking. 
          We reserve the right to extend an alternative qualification criterion ("Last Chance Qualifier").  This would require exceeding a specified win rate over a large sample of battles against 
          the strongest organizer baselines.

      <div class="card showdown-content">

        <p>Competitive Pokémon is extremely complex and creates an interesting game-playing benchmark all by itself. 
          However, it is arguably <em>Pokémon's popularity</em> and <em>Showdown's data availability</em> that really sets this domain apart in the current AI research landscape:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Pokémon's widespread internet presence gives LLMs extensive knowledge of its mechanics and strategies.</li>
          <li>Pokémon Showdown makes millions of competitive battles publicly available, enabling the creation of large, high-quality datasets.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Taken together, Pokémon is an exciting opportunity for areas like LLMs and RL to compete and collaborate. In that spirit, the PokéAgent Challenge was organized
          by the teams behind <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/pokechamp-llm?pli=1" target="_blank">PokéChamp</a> 
          and <a href="https://metamon.tech" target="_blank">Metamon</a>, which are recent papers that demonstrate strong human-level play 
          in singles formats. Both projects are open-source and have recently been updated to create a more helpful starting point for this competition.
          We have also been joined by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10326" target="_blank">VGC-Bench</a> to extend support to VGC (doubles)!

          These projects have their own repositories and publications where you can find more detailed information. 
          This page highlights specific resources from these efforts (and the wider Showdown AI community) that are broadly applicable to new methods,

        <h3>Datasets</h3>
        
        <h4>Showdown Replay Logs</h4>
        <p>
          Showdown makes battle <a href="https://replay.pokemonshowdown.com" target="_blank">replays</a> accessible via a public API, 
          but the competition organizers maintain curated datasets for convenience and (a little) extra privacy, and host them on huggingface to spare Showdown download requests from this competition. 
          We'd encourage you to use them unless you have a good reason not to. 
          Collectively, they cover the entire range of supported rulesets for the competition:
        </p>

        <div class="dataset-table">
          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>HuggingFace</th>
                <th>Formats</th>
                <th>Time Period</th>
                <th>Battles</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>

              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>

        <h4>Replays as Agent Training Data</h4>
        <p>
          Showdown replays are saved from the point of view of a spectator rather than the point of view of a player, 
          which can make it difficult to use them directly in an imperfect information game like Pokémon. 
          We need to reconstruct (and often <em>predict</em>) the perspective of each player to create a more usable offline RL or imitation learning dataset.
        </p>

        <p>
          <code>metamon</code> converts its replay dataset into a flexible format that allows customization of observations, actions, and rewards. 
          More than 3.5M full battle trajectories are stored on huggingface at 
          <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/jakegrigsby/metamon-parsed-replays" target="_blank"><code>metamon-parsed-replays</code></a> 
          and can be accessed through the metamon repo. Utilities in <code>pokechamp</code> can recreate its LLM-Agent prompts and decisions from replays in a similar fashion. 
          <code>vgc-bench</code> covers the Gen 9 VGC ruleset and does not have to resort to predicting unobserved information 
          (because VGC replays can have "Open Team Sheets" where ground-truth team info is public).
        </p>

        <h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
        <p>
          <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/jakegrigsby/metamon-teams" target="_blank"><code>teams</code></a>: 
          All of the Showdown rulesets in the competition require players to pick their own teams. This dataset provides sets of teams gathered from forums, 
          predicted from replays, and/or procedurally generated from Showdown trends. This creates a starting point for anyone less familiar with Competitive Pokémon, 
          and it is primarily intended to establish diverse team sets for self-play.
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/jakegrigsby/metamon-usage-stats" target="_blank"><code>usage-stats</code></a>: 
          A convenient way to access the <a href="https://www.smogon.com/stats/" target="_blank">Showdown team usage stats</a> 
          for the formats covered by the competition and the timeframe covered by the replay datasets. 
          <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/jakegrigsby/metamon-parsed-replays" target="_blank">This dataset</a> 
          also includes a log of all the partially revealed teams in replays. Team prediction is an interesting subproblem that your method may want to address!
        </p>

        <h3>Baselines</h3>
        <p>
          Organizers will inflate the player pool on the PokéAgent ladder with a rotating cast of existing baselines covering a wide range of skill levels and team choices.
          At launch, these will include:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Simple Heuristics</strong> to simulate the low-ELO ladder and let new methods get started. These are mainly sourced from <code>metamon</code>'s basic evaluation opponents.</li>
          <li><strong>The best <code>metamon</code> and <code>pokechamp</code> agents</strong> playing with competitive team choices. 
          These baselines have already demonstrated performance comparable to strong human players. If all goes well, they will be at the bottom of the leaderboard by the end of the competition!</li>
          <li><strong>Mixed <code>metamon</code> and <code>pokechamp</code> agents</strong> aimed at increasing variety and forcing participants to battle teams that resemble the real Showdown ladder. 
          For example, varied LLM backends with several prompting and search strategies. Hundreds of checkpoints from metamon policies 
          at various stages of training, sampling from thousands of unique teams.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Launch baselines are already open-source, so you are free to skip the ladder queue by hosting them on your local server with help from their home repo. 
          Any additional (stronger) agents in development by the organizers will be added to the ladder rotation as the competition progresses.
        </p>

        <p>
          We hope the ladder will also be full of participants trying new ideas; your agents' competition will always be improving!
        </p>

        <h3>Support and Additional Showdown AI Resources</h3>
        <p>
          Competition staff will be active on the community discord and are committed to answering questions (and fixing any issues that may arise) 
          related to the starter datasets, baselines, competition logistics, and Showdown/Pokémon more broadly. 
          However, due to limited bandwidth, we caution that the technical details involved in improving upon provided methods may be deemed out-of-scope (e.g., RL training details beyond the provided documentation). Still, you are welcome to ask, and we will help in any way we can.
