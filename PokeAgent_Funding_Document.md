# PokéAgent Challenge Funding Proposal

**Point of contact:** Seth Karten, sethkarten@princeton.edu

## TL;DR
We're planning to run a NeurIPS 2025 competition featuring two tracks that position Pokémon as an ideal testbed for artificial intelligence research. The PokéAgent Challenge addresses fundamental challenges in decision-making through competitive battling and game speedrunning. Our organizing team represents diverse expertise from Princeton, UT Austin, Carnegie Mellon, and Google DeepMind. We are looking to raise funding to support computing requirements, human evaluation, prizes, and competition infrastructure.

## What is this competition?

The PokéAgent Challenge is designed to establish Pokémon as a benchmark for general decision-making in AI through two complementary tracks:

**Track 1: Competitive Battling** challenges agents to master one of the most complex zero-sum partially observable games available, with a state space complexity estimated at 10^354 possible states. Unlike perfect information games like chess or Go, Pokémon requires sophisticated opponent modeling under persistent partial observability, where critical information is revealed only through gameplay.

**Track 2: RPG Speedrunning** requires agents to navigate through a vast, partially observable world, balancing exploration with exploitation while making thousands of sequential decisions. This track highlights the challenges of long-horizon reasoning and planning that mirror real-world sequential decision problems.

Participants will have access to our dataset of 3.5 million battles and a comprehensive knowledge base of reference materials from forums and tutorials. We'll provide varied baselines including rule-based, reinforcement learning, and LLM-powered agents to help participants evaluate their progress.

## Why support this competition?

The PokéAgent Challenge offers several compelling reasons for support:

1. **Scientific Impact**: The competition addresses critical frontiers in AI research at the intersection of reinforcement learning, game theory, planning, and language models. It creates a standardized benchmark for opponent modeling under partial observability and long-horizon reasoning—two capabilities essential for advancing AI beyond controlled environments.

2. **Bridging AI Communities**: The competition uniquely unifies research in reinforcement learning and large language models, encouraging collaboration across these communities to solve complex decision-making problems.

3. **Broad Participation**: Pokémon's universal appeal creates an accessible yet deep domain requiring minimal expertise while supporting sophisticated methods. We anticipate 300-500 participants based on recent game AI competitions and Pokémon's broad appeal.

4. **Real-World Applications**: Techniques developed for this competition have direct applications in cybersecurity (opponent modeling), robotics and autonomous vehicles (long-horizon planning), and systems that integrate knowledge-based and experience-based AI approaches.

5. **Diverse Organizing Team**: Our organizers bring expertise from top institutions including Princeton, UT Austin, Carnegie Mellon, and Google DeepMind, ensuring high-quality competition design and execution.

## What does additional funding buy?

We are seeking funding to support the following competition expenses (in order of priority):

1. **$50,000**: Computing infrastructure for baseline training, participant support, and evaluation. This will ensure equitable access to resources for all participants regardless of their institutional affiliation.

2. **$30,000**: Platform development and maintenance with AICrowd or similar platforms to host leaderboards, manage submissions, and ensure fair evaluation.

3. **$25,000**: Prize money to incentivize participation and reward top-performing teams ($5,000-$10,000 for winners in each track, with smaller prizes for runners-up).

4. **$20,000**: Data collection and annotation for evaluation, including human evaluation of agent performance in both tracks.

5. **$25,000**: Research engineering time to ensure the competition runs smoothly, troubleshoot issues, and provide support to participants.

6. **$25,000**: Travel grants to support diverse participation, ensuring teams from institutions with limited resources can participate in the competition and present at NeurIPS 2025.

7. **$15,000**: Documentation, tutorials, and educational materials to make the competition accessible to newcomers and experienced researchers alike.

8. **$10,000**: Contingency fund for unexpected expenses or opportunities that arise during the competition.

## Next Steps

The competition is scheduled to launch in July 2025, with final results announced in October 2025 and presentation at NeurIPS in December 2025. Our team has already made significant progress in preparing datasets, developing baseline agents, and designing evaluation protocols.

Your support will help establish a new benchmark for AI research that addresses fundamental challenges in decision-making while bridging different AI research communities. We welcome the opportunity to discuss partnership opportunities and recognition for sponsors.
